# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Styled the Simon game. 

**Thoughts:** Practicing the use of flex vs position:absolute. usually would go for flex, but this seems like actually a place for position.

**Link to work:** no link - for some reason can't push to github...

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic Simon Game.

**Thoughts:** Major problem with the game was making the different colors animate. Used document.querySelector, setTimeout and setInterval, felt like a major hack- need to figure out how to do it with React.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Moved simon game to use create-react-app for clearer code. Uploaded to github and submitted to FCC

**Thoughts:** Was going to ask for my certificate, but I want to go over the projects and see if there's any change I want to do. Additionaly I should add an about page to my code saying what packages I use (jQuery, bootstrap, etc. )
